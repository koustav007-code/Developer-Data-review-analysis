## Notebook 1: `EDA.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis

### Purpose:
To understand the underlying patterns in the dataset through visualization, statistics, and preliminary data cleaning.

### Key Steps:
- **Loading Data:** Reads in a dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
- **Data Overview:** Displays data head, info, and shape to understand structure.
- **Missing Values:** Checks for and handles missing values.
- **Descriptive Stats:** Uses `describe()` to summarize data.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots for outliers
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Pairplots for relationships between variables
- **Data Cleaning:** Drops or imputes missing/invalid data.

## Notebook 2: `Automation.ipynb` – Automation Workflow

### Purpose:
To automate repeated tasks such as data pre-processing, transformation, or feature engineering.

### Key Steps:
- **Function Definitions:** Encapsulates common tasks into reusable functions.
- **Looped Processing:** Uses loops or batch execution logic to process multiple files or datasets.
- **Data Transformation:** Performs operations like scaling, encoding, or normalizing features.
- **Saving Output:** Saves processed data or generated reports.
