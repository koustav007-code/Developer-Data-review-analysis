# Project: Data Analysis and Automation Workflow

This project contains two core Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `EDA.ipynb` – for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. `Automation.ipynb` – for automating repetitive tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, or reporting

---

## 📁 Files Overview

### `EDA.ipynb`
- Loads and explores a dataset
- Handles missing values
- Visualizes key statistics and relationships
- Identifies outliers and distributions

### `Automation.ipynb`
- Automates a sequence of data-related tasks
- Includes pre-processing functions
- Likely integrated for batch execution or scheduled runs

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Install required libraries using:
```bash

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open `EDA.ipynb` to explore the data.
4. Run `Automation.ipynb` to automate the pipeline or processes.
